# Biometrics-Project
This is the Mini Project for Biometrics.

## Aim: 
Our aim in this project is to create a biometric identification system using face recognition for faces wearing masks. 
This project was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was a serious health risk that prompted people to start wearing masks
