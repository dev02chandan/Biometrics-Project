# Biometrics-Project
This was a project to create a system to identify individuals who are genuine vs imposters, while wearing face masks. This project was inspired by the COVID 19 pandemic, which was a serious health risk that prompted people to start wearing masks. Our contribution was the new dataset that we created as well as the results, which classified imposters accurately.
